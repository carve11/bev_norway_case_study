# Google Data Analytics Capstone - Case Study: BEV's in Norway
[Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone) is the last course in a series of 8 cources that are part of [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) program that I completed online on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) in the first half of 2024. For the case study I chose track B, which meant that I have worked on a dataset that I found myself, that covers battery electric vehicles (BEV) in Norway. The case study is described in detail in the web document associated with this repository. 

All preparing, processing and analyzing of the dataset was carried out in R. Used `rjstat` to read JSON stat2 format files, which returns the data as tibble dataframes. Processing the data covered converting (`mutate`) character columns to integers, create date columns (`lubridate` package), calculations on `group_by` variables, merging dataframes, and filter data for proper visualization. Used `ggplot2` to create figures and analyzing trends. For proper styling of the figures I used Plotly package `ggplotly` and in order to get HTML output from R I used `htmlwidgets` package.
